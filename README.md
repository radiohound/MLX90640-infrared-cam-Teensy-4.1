# MLX90640-infrared-cam-Teensy-4.1
This project displays heat related image on a TFT display and locates the highest temp. It was based off Adafruit's MLX90640 code from <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MLX90640/blob/master/examples/MLX90640_arcadaCam/MLX90640_arcadaCam.ino">here.</a> This project uses a 1.8" TFT display module 160x128 pixels (a ST7735 display) and a Teensy 4.1 from www.pjrc.com.

It surprised me that such a small infrared imaging sensor could get a fairly reasonable image of with only a 32x24 array. I can also see the heat from a small wifi mesh device about 14 feet away, which appears as a few pixels wide.
